3. Objects and Classes -Blueprint Instance of a class 
4. Databases -H2
6. Enums, Interfaces, Abstract Classes
7. Inheritance- is a relationship 
8. Polymorphism -Interpertating objects in many diffrent ways
10 Encapsulation- Placing data and methods in one unit -information hidding-not visible outside the object
